This repository is based on a codacademy project. All went well for the most part; I ended up having to download an extension to vs. code that lets you update remote repositories locally without pulling a clone because I was struggling with adding and committing after the initial push. I definitely need to practice that. The other problem I ran into with this project was when I pulled it up on my iPhone, the video did not play. Based on some googling it looks like the mobile version is set up to do this because of individual data plans, meaning that the user has to interact with the page before the autoplay begins. The trouble is I didn't have any real actionable interactions. I would like to come back to this project and figure out a solution, but I am thinking I might need java.script to solve my problem.
